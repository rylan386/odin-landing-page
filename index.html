            <h1>What is Coffee?</h1>
            <p>Coffee is a dark-colored, bitter, slightly acidic beverage that has a stimulating effect on humans, owing to the caffeine content. 
                It is one of the world's most popular beverages and can be prepared and served in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). 
                Coffee is normally served hot, but cooled or iced coffee is also popular. To mask the bitterness or increase the flavor, sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, or cream are frequently applied. 
                It goes well with coffee cake or a sweet dessert such as doughnuts. A coffeehouse or coffee shop is a commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages.</p>
